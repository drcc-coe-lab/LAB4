13. Your account is provisioning and should be available soon! You might want to log out as you wait for your account to be provisioned. You'll receive two emails from Oracle. One email will be the initial notification that provisioning is underway. The other email will be a notification that provisioning is complete. Here is a copy of the final notification:![Account Provisioned](media/a416900ab85078270f7e40ab02abfe8b.png)

## Task 2: Sign in to Your Account

*Please note that while your tenancy is initially created, you will only see a direct login. Once your tenancy is fully provisioned, you will see the screens as described below.*

1.  Go to [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com/). Enter your Cloud Account Name and click **Next**. This is the name you chose while creating your account in the previous section. It's NOT your email address. If you've forgotten the name, see the confirmation email.

2.  Click **Continue** to sign in using the *"oraclecloudidentityservice"*.

    ![Sign In](media/553908774635b48f48a37f46f403c862.png)

    When you sign up for an Oracle Cloud account, a user is created for you in Oracle Identity Cloud Service with the username and password you selected at sign up. You can use this single sign-on option to sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and then navigate to other Oracle Cloud services without re-authenticating. This user has administrator privileges for all the Oracle Cloud services included with your account.

3.  Enter your Cloud Account credentials and click **Sign In**. Your user name is your email address. The password is what you chose when you signed up for an account.

**About This Workshop**

Explore the process of deploying the EBS Cloud Manager, which you can use to create EBS environments in OCI. This process uses the Marketplace EBS Cloud Manager Stack. In this workshop, you will connect to an OCI tenancy and create a user, group, and an application through IDCS. Then, create an EBS Cloud Manager instance and associate networking components using the Marketplace stacks on OCI. Finally, from the Cloud Manager created you will automate the creation of an EBS environment and then clone it.
